<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Explore incredible places far from the Mushroom Kingdom as you join Mario and his new ally Cappy on a massive, globe-trotting 3D adventure.

    Use amazing new abilities—like the power to capture and control objects, animals, and enemies—to collect Power Moons so you can power 
    up the Odyssey airship and save Princess Peach from Bowser's wedding plans!

    Thanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, Mario's got new moves that'll make you rethink his traditional run-and-jump gameplay—like cap 
    jump, cap throw, and capture. Use captured cohorts such as enemies, objects, and animals to progress through the game and uncover 
    loads of hidden collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them a Joy-Con™ controller! Player 1 controls 
    Mario while Player 2 controls Cappy. This sandbox-style 3D Mario adventure—the first since 1996's beloved Super Mario 64™ and 2002's 
    Nintendo GameCube™ classic Super Mario Sunshine™—is packed with secrets and surprises, plus exciting new kingdoms to explore.

<h2>Review</h2>
<p>
    <blockquote>"It’s impossible to pinpoint a fault in Super Mario Odyssey, which both elegantly and eloquently surprises and 
        calls back to its storied history. It’s a game full of surprises; one that plays with your expectations and supersedes 
        them in almost every way. If you have a Switch (or are yet to get one), it’s simply essential."
