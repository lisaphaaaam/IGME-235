bio:
My name is Lisa Pham. I am a college sophomore at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am majoring in Game Design and Development. I want to be at a major game company like Riot, EpicGames, or Nintendo after I graduate in 2025. 
My interests are art, traveling, fashion, and games. Some goals I have are to travel to Asia and Europe, go to all of my favorite artists' concerts, and adopt a cat.
